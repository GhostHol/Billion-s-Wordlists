# Billion's Wordlist
# Billion's Wordlist's all combinations.

Billion words is a huge collection of words, containing countless possible combinations. 
This collection of words can be used for a variety of purposes, including cybersecurity, data analysis, and creativity.

# The Power of Billion Words

The Billion word pool has some significant power.
```txt
- Firstly, this set of words is very large, which means that it covers a wide range of possibilities.
  This can make it an invaluable tool for cybersecurity, where it can be used to crack passwords or find patterns in data.

- Second, this collection of words can be used to produce creative texts, such as poetry, code, or scripts.
  It can be a valuable tool for writers, developers, and artists.
```

# Theory
Lowercase letters have 26 possibilities, uppercase letters have 26 possibilities, numbers have 10 possibilities, and symbols have 32 possibilities. 
Thus, there are 26 + 26 + 10 + 32 = 94 possible characters that can be used in each word position.

For example, if the word length is 1, then there are 94 possible combinations. If the word length is 2, then there are 94^2 = 8836 possible combinations. 
If the word length is 3, then there are 94^3 = 774184 possible combinations. Etc.

Thus, the number of combinations of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols is 36^n, where n is the length of the word.

Here are some examples of the number of combinations for a given word length:
```txt
Word length 1: 94
Word length 2: 8836
Word length 3: 774184
Word length 4: 6834328
Word length 5: 60466176
```
For example, for a word length of 10, there are 36^10 = 1,677,721,600 possible combinations. 
This means that there are over a billion possible words that can be made with any combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

# Combination
uses all the symbols available on a `US QWERTY keyboard`, namely `95` symbols
First I used Lowercase Alphabet Letters
```ts
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
```

Secondly I use Uppercase Alphabet Letters
```ts
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
```

Thirdly I use numbers
```ts
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
```

Finally, the fourth uses symbols
```ts
! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = { } [ ] | : ; ' < , . ? / ~ \ " ` >
```

# Conclusion

The Billion word pool is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of purposes. 
However, it is important to understand its strengths and weaknesses before using it.

Here are some specific examples of how Billion words can be used:
```txt
- Cybersecurity: The Billion word pool can be used to crack passwords or find patterns in data.
  For example, this word set can be used to try all possible combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols for a password.

- Data analysis: A collection of Billion words can be used to analyze text data.
  For example, these word sets can be used to find patterns in text, such as words that frequently
  appear together or the general sentiment of the text.

- Creativity: The Billion word pool can be used to produce creative text, such as poetry, code, or scripts.
  For example, this set of words could be used to produce a poem that uses all the letters of the alphabet.
```
Ultimately, the best way to use Billion words is to adapt them to your specific needs.

# notes
My goal in making Billion's wordlists is to serve as `educational material` and help in `solving unsolved problems`. 
This has words that are impossible and not impossible in this project

# Version
Each version has its own advantages and the bigger the version, the more wordlists it contains.
